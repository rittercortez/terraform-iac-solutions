# 🌐 **Terraform Project Hub**

## **Description**
🎉 Welcome to my Terraform project collection! This repository showcases my **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)** skills, organized progressively and categorized by difficulty level. Here's what you'll find:

- **✅ Functional projects:** Solving various cloud scenarios and challenges
- **📂 Learning exercises:** Located in the **`concepts/`** folder, focusing on key Terraform concepts.
- **🛠️ Categorized projects** to highlight the progression of skills and best practices.

---

## **🌟 Repository Structure**

### **1. Concepts Folder (`concepts/`)**
📘 **Purpose:** Practice and learn specific Terraform concepts.  
This folder includes small and functional examples that demonstrate:

- How to use modules.
- Configuring individual resources (like S3, VPC, and subnets).
- Exploring dynamic functions, variables, and locals.

These examples are perfect for isolating concepts and building a solid foundation.

---

### **2. Projects in `aws/`**
Inside the `aws/` folder, you'll find **projects categorized into three levels**, each prefixed to indicate the difficulty level:

#### **✨ Beginner Projects (Level 1)**
**Prefix:** `01-basic-`  
🔹 Functional projects with room for improvement in best practices, such as:  
- Limited use of modules.  
- Basic code organization.

#### **🚀 Intermediate Projects (Level 2)**
**Prefix:** `02-intermediate-`  
🔹 Projects that implement best practices, including:  
- Efficient use of modules for reusable code.  
- Separation of variables, outputs, and main configuration files.  
- More advanced functionality (conditionals, loops, etc.).

#### **💼 Advanced Projects (Level 3)**
**Prefix:** `03-advanced-`  
🔹 High-complexity projects designed to:  
- Solve real-world business scenarios.  
- Address complex errors.  
- Integrate multiple AWS services.

## **🚧 Future Plans**
💡 This repository will continue to grow with:  
1. New projects covering more AWS services and use cases.  
2. Solutions to complex problems encountered in enterprise environments.  
3. Conceptual exercises serving as reference material for Terraform learners.  

---

## **🔍 How to Navigate**
1. **Start with basics:** Check out the `concepts/` folder to understand key Terraform elements.  
2. **Explore complete projects:** Dive into the `aws/` folder for projects organized by difficulty.  
3. **Identify levels:** Use the folder prefix to quickly identify the complexity of each project.
